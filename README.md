Just a bunch of tools to enjoy malware detection on virtual machine

<hr />

*Random create* is a tool to generate fake files and directories.
Just give a number of files, a path and a avg size (per file)!
It's also possible to use already existing directories, give a custom list of
extensions to the files, create new sub-directories.

Other features will be implemented in future.
